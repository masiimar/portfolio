 			<h2>My country.</h2><br>
 			<p>I come from Estonia that lies on the Eastern Coast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. Estonia, with a population of only 1.4 million, regained its independence from the Soviet Union in the '90s after 50 years of occupation. Estonia has the forth smallest population in the European Union. The country is flat as a pancake – its highest peak is 318 metres (1,043 ft) above sea level – and it’s also the highest in the Baltic states. Estonia has a coastline fragmented with 1521 islands.</p><br>

 			<h2>My family.</h2><br>
 			<p>I have a wonderful family. I have a twin brother, Kristofer, who also plays tennis and goes to the University of Michigan. My mother, Kristina, loves photography and to travel to exotic places. When she is home and not working, she likes to spend time in our garden. My father, Ivar, loves playing tennis and basketball in his free time. He also enjoys goofying around and making people laugh. We have a dog, Helga, who is always ready to chase tennis balls.</p><br>

 			<h2>My hobbies.</h2><br>
 			<p>Even though I have always been busy with tennis and school, I have a few hobbies. I love fishing and snowboarding. I started finishing when I was four years old. Fishing is my grandfather’s favorite hobby, so he took my brother and I always with him. Every summer when I went to my grandparents’ cottage, we used to wake at six in the morning and fishing until midday. I love fishing because it gives me a chance to take a break from my fast-paced life and enjoy beautiful Estonian nature. </p><br>

 		<div id = "snowboarding">
 			<p>I also love snowboarding. Since I was three years old, my family and a few of our friends have been to ski trips every year in the majestic Alps. During the past 19 years, we have been to France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland several times. The trips are usually about a week and we take a couple of days to visit cities that are close by. I enjoy snowboarding because I love the adrenaline rush that I get from speeding down the biggest mountains of Europe. I also admire the scenery of European mountain villages.</p><br>
